def my_func(a, b):
	# code here

In the above code, we create the function 'my_func()'
a and b are the parameters of the defined function.

Later when we call the function:

x = 10
y - 'a'
my_func(x, y)

x and y are the arguments of the function.

NOTE: a and b are variables inside the function.
When we pass in x and y, the memory address is given to the function.
This means a and b will also point to the memory address 
from the function's scope. Whereas x and y point to 
the same memory addresses from the module's scope.
